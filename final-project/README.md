The website will present a curated selection of my best work while also providing insights into my personal identity. It will serve as a creative platform to narrate my unique story and showcase my professional development.

### Idea 3- African Food Recipes

![title for sketch1](../assets/ideas/idea3.png)

- What is the basic idea of your final project? (1-2 sentences)

A website dedicated to countries of africa and the food recipes based off popular dishes.

- How do you plan to make your design interactive and engaging?

User engagement will be enhanced through interactive elements such as clickable food images. When users find a recipe of interest, they can click on it to access detailed information about the dish.

- How do you plan to make your design accessible?

Accessibility will be prioritized by implementing alt text for images and utilizing semantic HTML elements throughout the website's structure. I will also be making sure to use the https://wave.webaim.org/ tool to evaluate the accessibility of my webpage.

The website will present a diverse array of cuisines from all regions of Africa. The goal is to promote African culinary traditions and make them accessible to a global audience, encouraging everyone to explore and try these dishes.

## Feedback Summary

During the lab session, my classmates gave me feedback on my two website projects. For my African Food Recipes website, they had some cool ideas. I was wondering how to categorize regions with content on the main page, and they suggested I could use a scrapbook theme. They liked my idea of having an interactive map on one side of the screen where users could hover over countries. They told me to check out the Eater site for inspiration and to add more content for each region.

I was thinking about having background photos and making the map interactive when you hover over a country. My classmates thought that was good and suggested I look into using Vega-Lite (https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/examples/geo_choropleth.html) to create the map. They also said I should color-code the regions and include both recipes and info about the most represented countries in each area. I asked how I could incorporate an API, JS library or web animation into this idea, and they encouraged me to explore those options. They also thought it would be cool if I could make the recipes downloadable or printable.

For my Resell website for sneakers, I was worried about how to appeal to both buyers who want new and used sneakers. I had this idea of creating a logo with a shoe that's half old and half new, and my classmates liked that. They suggested I have two sections, one for new and one for used sneakers.
I was thinking about how to show the condition of the shoes, and they said I should have full pictures and maybe put a condition grade above each shoe. They also thought I should add filters for shoe brands to make it easier for users to find what they want.

My portfolio will not be of focus for my final project since I already have one live. I will use the other two ideas and narrow and use that to add to my perosnal website.

## Feedback Digestion

Based on the feedback I received during the lab session, I've decided to focus my design on the African Food Recipes website. Being from Nigeria, an African country, I feel more connected to this project. The feedback I received also suggested that this concept has more potential for user interaction and impact. One of the main critiques I'll be acting on is implementing an interactive map on one side of the screen. This feature will allow users to hover over countries for more information, which I think will greatly enhance the user experience and make the site more engaging. I plan to explore using Vega-Lite to create this map, as it seems to offer the functionality I need. I also like the suggestion of color-coding regions and presenting both recipes and information about the most represented countries in each area. This approach will help users quickly identify different regions and provide a more comprehensive cultural context for the recipes. The idea of incorporating a scrapbook theme for the main page is intriguing, and I think it could add a unique visual appeal to the site.

Making recipes downloadable or printable is another suggestion I'll definitely incorporate, as it will add practical value for users who want to try the recipes offline. While I appreciate the suggestion to look into the Eater site for inspiration, I'll be cautious about this to ensure my site maintains its unique identity. I'll use it more as a reference point rather than a direct model. I'm still considering how to best incorporate an API or JavaScript library to make the site more dynamic, which might be a feature I develop in later iterations of the project.

Currently, I am leaning more towards the regions of african country feedback I got to educates users about the rich culinary diversity of the continent. I also did not focus on a portfolio as my TA suggested that the other two ideas could beneift me more since I already have a portfolio website live. I used this feedback to focus on my other two ideas.
